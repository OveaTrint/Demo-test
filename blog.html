                I don’t think you understood the skill, it’s basically a
                smoother sharp touch, that’s it really…. Unlike a touch where
                there is space between the player and the ball after executing,
                with Acc Burst, the player kinda drags the ball with him… it’s a
                classic move Neymar does a lot irl
            </p>

                The skill is that the player can knock the ball in a specific
                direction then quickly accelerate. It's probably gonna be useful
                when there's space on the wings. Idk whether you have to knock
                the ball on by holding dash or if you just change direction.
                Just go to training and try it.

            <h2>Acceleration Burst is a Scam</h2>
            <p class="post">
                Because I felt literally no difference at all while finesse
                dribbling nor when I was changing directions with and without
                dashing with Kubo. I also saw no new player animations and felt
                no difference while moving & dribbling with him in general. In
                fact he doesn't even really feel that smooth to play with even
                though I've given him the build that I have attached. Is this
                just cause it's Kubo in which case it's a real shame that Konami
                can just get away with this. Also I'm someone who dribbles a lot
                and I'm pretty good at it but this card literally just felt like
                another mid potw Kubo card. Should I just give him flip flap to
                enable ball roll and call it a day?
